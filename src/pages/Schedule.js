        <td><p>“Fetch the Bride” Door Games</p>
    This is a part of Chinese wedding traditions. To “fetch the bride” for the wedding, the groom and groomsmen (the brothers) will need to complete challenges set out by the bridesmaids (the sisters).
    If you are interested to attend this traditional, but unofficial part of the wedding, please let us know, and please come to our villa at Trisara at least 15 minutes earlier.
